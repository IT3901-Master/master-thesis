\chapter{Results \& Discussion}

This chapter provides all final results yielded by the user survey, and the offline benchmark test of the CBR module, as well as a discussion and analysis of the data.

\section{User Survey}


\subsection{Motivational effect}


\subsection{CBR domain suitability}




\section{Offline Test}

By using the score matrix given by table \ref{tab:offline_test}, 20 different simulated user made queries yielded the scores seen in table \ref{tab:offline_test_results}. The same queries were ran on the main CBR model configuration, which the system uses, as well as a \enquote{dumb} configuration, which was created to simulate a more traditional filter search, where each attribute only return a similarity of $1.0$ if it is a direct match, and $0.0$ if not.
