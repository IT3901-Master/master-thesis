This research was conducted for a master's degree in informatics by two students specialized in artificial intelligence and software respectively, between August 2016 and June 2017, at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Since we both would like the process of applying for an exchange program to be both easier and more accessible, receiving positive results from this research was very rewarding. We hope we have contributed to a future of more study exchange, and that we can take this project further.

We would like to thank our adviser, Rune Sætre, for his helpful guidance and feedback throughout the year, Agnar Aamodt for reviewing and approving our initial project idea, Kertin Bach for helping us with everything regarding CBR and MyCBR, tailoring a MyCBR extension for our project, and guiding the development of our CBRS. Furthermore, we would like to thank all students who helped us out by participating on usability tests during the development process, and those who took their time to answer our questionnaires. Thanks to Terje Rydland for providing feedback on the student adviser part of the system, and for further guiding our project together with Rune Sætre. Lastly, we would like to thank our belowed friends, family for the continuous support.
