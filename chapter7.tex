\subsection{Application Features}
Suggestions for improving the 
During interviews with exchange course advisers and users several proposed useful features were discovered. Many of these were included in the project but some were too complex and was outside of the scope. In a possible further work it is proposed to include some or all of these features. 


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Advisor comments on course applications
    \item Change Course Applications
    \item Automatic review of course matches with date-of-expiration
    \item Filter course matches on users institute
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expanding and Improving the Model of the CBRS}
- More factors (Cost of living, weather/climate)
- Adapt to new experience reports with bundled course matches
- Gain feedback on recommendation relevance
- search with courses

\subsection{Experiments}
Due to lack of time and resources such as money and participants, there was no extensive experiments made to test Utsida in a real world situation. The following suggestions include ways to see Utsida's effect in real world cases.

\subsubsection{Testing Utsida in an application Process}


\subsubsection{Observing Real Effects of Utsida}
If Utsida was to be included in application process for an exchange program by The Office of International Relations at NTNU, it would have been interesting to study the number of students applying with the system in use compared to current numbers. If there had been a significant increase of students applying after Utsida was included, it would suggest that the system helped NTNU with its goal of sending more of its students on exchange programs.
