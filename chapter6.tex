\section{Further work}

\subsection{CBR extensions}
- More factors (Cost of living, weather/climate)
- Adapt to new experience reports with bundled course matches
- Gain feedback on recommendation relevance
- search with courses

\subsection{Application features}
During interviews with exchange course advisers and users several proposed useful features were discovered. Many of these were included in the project but some were too complex and was outside of the scope. In a possible further work it is proposed to include some or all of these features. 


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Advisor comments on course applications
    \item Change course applications
    \item Automatic review of course matches with date-of-expiration
    \item Filter course matches on users institute
\end{itemize}
